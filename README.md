# My Contribution:

I played a supporting role in designing the gearbox using Fusion, I mainly produced detailed CAD drawings to visualize the concept. Additionally, I conducted stress load calculations and made critical decisions regarding the gearbox internal configuration, including the selection of components like oil rings and bearings.
