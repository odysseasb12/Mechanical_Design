# My Contribution:

I particularly took role in designing the gearbox in Fusion and producing the CAD drawings. I also, performed calculations for the stress loads and decided on the gearbox's configuration, such as oil rings, bearings, etc.

I played a supporting role in designing the gearbox using Fusion, I mainly produced detailed CAD drawings to visualize the concept. Additionally, I conducted stress load calculations and made critical decisions regarding the gearbox internal configuration, including the selection of components like oil rings and bearings.
